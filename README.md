# When2Meet Representation

Introduction
============

This application is based on the [SI579 Project: react-when2meet](https://github.com/ekassos/when2meet-representation) software developed by [tcy1999](https://github.com/tcy1999). The code was modified as a way to implement a user-testable version of When2Meet for Harvard's CS279R.

Installation
============

Run the following commands (you can ignore the dependency issues warnings):
```console
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

### When2Meet Representation should be open on a browser window.

Improvements
============

1. The distribution was not working right out of the box, so I fixed the Firebase file.

1. Added comments to reflect code understanding.

1. Switched color back to green to better reflect When2Meet.
